# My 2 Weeks Internship Report at GKMIT

## Overview

Hello! 

So now it's almost 2 weeks I have joined GKMIT and I am writing this report on what I have done and learned in these 14 days. These 2 weeks were a really good experience for me because I got a chance to connect with seniors, SDE, leads and also learned about soft skills which are very important in the IT industry.

## Key Learning Experiences

### üìß Professional Email

One of the first things I did was send a professional thank you email to Seniors (Subam, Dhruvil and Shivam) whom I met yesterday. This was my first experience of writing a proper thank you mail in a professional environment. I realized how small things like sending thank you emails builds connections and shows respect.

!!! success "Professional Growth"
    Writing professional emails taught me how small gestures like thank you emails can build meaningful professional relationships.

### üéØ Self Improvement Goals

I decided two self improvement goals for myself:

**1. Communication Style**
- From now on I will not say Sir/Ma'am to anyone, instead I will use their name directly
- This is the culture of GKMIT and it feels more professional and equal

**2. Adaptation**

!!! tip "Culture Adaptation"
    As an intern, I want to learn everything here and adapt skills which suit the company.
