# My 2 Weeks Internship Report at GKMIT 📋✨

## Overview 👋

Hello! 

So now it's almost 2 weeks I have joined GKMIT and I am writing this report on what I have done and learned in these 14 days. These 2 weeks were a really good experience for me because I got a chance to connect with seniors, SDE, leads and also learned about soft skills which are very important in the IT industry.

## Key Learning Experiences 🎯

### 📧 Professional Email

One of the first things I did was send a professional thank you email to Seniors (Subam, Dhruvil and Shivam) whom I met yesterday. This was my first experience of writing a proper thank you mail in a professional environment. I realized how small things like sending thank you emails builds connections and shows respect.

!!! success "Professional Growth"
    Writing professional emails taught me how small gestures like thank you emails can build meaningful professional relationships.

### 🎯 Self Improvement Goals

I decided two self improvement goals for myself:

**1. Communication Style**
- From now on I will not say Sir/Ma'am to anyone, instead I will use their name directly
- This is the culture of GKMIT and it feels more professional and equal

**2. Adaptation**

!!! tip "Culture Adaptation"
    As an intern, I want to learn everything here and adapt skills which suit the company.

## My Inspiration Leader 🏆

### Favorite Leader: David Goggins

One leader I really admire is **David Goggins**. He is:
- Retired U.S. Navy SEAL
- Endurance athlete  
- Motivational speaker
- Author of "Can't Hurt Me" book

**The qualities I want to take from him:**
- 🧠 **Mental Toughness**

I strongly believe if we apply these 3 qualities in life then we can achieve almost impossible things.

### 1. 💼 Manager–Employee Interaction
I understood the importance of being honest and clear with managers. Mistakes will happen but how we react is what matters:

I'm currently pursuing my B.Tech at Geetanjali Institute of Technical Studies, Udaipur, and I've had the opportunity to work on two internships — one as a full-stack developer and another focusing on front-end technologies. Throughout my internships, I've honed my skills in web development and have tackled over 300 DSA (Data Structures & Algorithms) problems, which has really strengthened my problem-solving abilities. I'm always looking to learn and grow, and I consistently apply that to my work. I'm excited to continue growing as a developer and contribute to building impactful solutions."
